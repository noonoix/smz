# Classroom Studio v0.9.64f - Raspberry Pi Pico light-sensor + portable-plan firmware (CircuitPython)
# System: sim   generated: 2026-09-09   calibrated states: 0
# Sensor: BH1750 (GY-302 / GY-30) on I2C0 - SDA=GP20, SCL=GP21, ADDR->GND => 0x23
# Board roles: the Pico is the executive brain - keyboard (USB HID) + light sensor + macro
# engine. Mouse and the sound sensor belong to the Arduino Pro Micro, which the Pico drives
# as its arm over UART0: GP16 = TX -> Pro Micro RX, GP17 = RX <- Pro Micro TX, common GND,
# 115200 8N1.
#
# v0.9.60 - hardened consolidation (bench-proven as the 0.9.59h/k/m/n line):
#   * BH1750 OPTIONAL: the brain boots and answers PING even with the sensor unplugged;
#     WLUX/TRGLUX/LCAL then answer ERR|NOSENSOR and armed light states stay silent.
#   * Serial RX is a bounded BYTE buffer - no per-read string concat, no heap churn.
#   * The Pro Micro arm is pumped EVERY loop iteration: its EVT| lines stream to the PC
#     live and its small TX buffer can never fill up and wedge the arm.
#   * Mouse commands are fire-and-ack (forwarded to the arm, OK answered at once) so dense
#     human paths stay smooth; sound/SETRES still wait for the arm's real reply.
#   * The keyboard ALWAYS runs on this Pico: KBDPICO| and the legacy arm keyboard envelope
#     are both consumed locally - the arm never types.
#   * Fixed keypad: GP4->GND = Num Lock = Start/Stop, GP3->GND = Scroll Lock = Pause/Resume.
#     Both drive the standalone engine AND send the HID key to the PC.
#   * Safe default: boot never starts the macro. The standalone engine waits for GP4
#     (Num Lock) unless AUTOSTART below is explicitly True, and stays silent for 3 s after
#     the last host command so host-driven runs never double-fire the armed states.
#
# Copy code.py + boot.py + pico-calibration.json onto CIRCUITPY and put the
# adafruit_hid package into /lib. Full instructions: README-FLASH.md

# v0.9.62 - death-of-motion fixes (field evidence: 2026-09-09 record, 53.4 s run):
#   * GP4 start RE-ARMS the engine (start_engine): passes reset + flow ledger wiped.
#     The v0.9.61 LOOP_MODE="once" trap (passes never reset, so one early pass end -
#     a stray USB byte's PlanAbort or a swallowed error - silenced Num Lock until the
#     next power-cycle) is gone: every start revives the run.
#   * Arm-ack watchdog in pump_arm: the unframed pico<->arm UART could lose OK|MMOVE
#     acks and permanently skew _arm_lag; ARM_LAG_MAX lost acks meant eternal
#     coalescing - a frozen mouse on a fully living Pico. Lag with no ack for
#     ARM_ACK_TIMEOUT now self-heals and flushes the newest target.
#   * Faults are VISIBLE with no PC attached: plan run errors ALWAYS print + flash
#     the onboard LED x3; plan parse errors print even with PLAN_DEBUG=False; LED
#     state: solid = running, slow blink = paused, off = stopped; x2 flashes = boot.
#   * Boot banner prints the version; PONG reports pico-light 0.9.62.
#
# v0.9.64 - persistent portable cursor across Stop/Start (keeps all v0.9.63 shields):
#   ghost button events correlated with dense MMOVE traffic on the unframed UART,
#   and one Right Down never saw its Up (a button held at the HID level = Windows
#   unclickable until Ctrl+Alt+Del). release_all_buttons() sends MUP|left/right/middle
#   on every engine stop, every engine start (clean slate), every plan abort/error,
#   and on host HALT/BYE - a held button can never survive a stop.
#   (ships as code63.py - built from the code62 tree via splice edits)
#
# v0.9.64b - no more start/stop teleport (record analysis 2026-09-09, 14 GP4 toggles):
#   arm fw>=1.8 syncs its tracked axes into EVERY button report (cursor_sync), so the
#   v0.9.63 unconditional MUP x3 on start/stop teleported the cursor back to the last
#   plan point whenever the user had moved the physical mouse while stopped (5 snaps
#   of 964-1216 px in the same millisecond as the keypress, each followed by exactly
#   three identical position reports = the three MUP reports).
#   * release_all_buttons is now CONDITIONAL on the routine GP4 start/stop path: the
#     Pico tracks MDOWN/MUP itself (_held_buttons) and releases only genuinely held
#     buttons - empty set = zero MUP = zero cursor_sync = zero teleport.
#   * force=True keeps the full three-button v0.9.63 shield on the abnormal paths
#     (host HALT/BYE, plan abort, plan run error).
#   * Panic gesture: holding GP4 >= 1 s force-releases all three buttons + 5 LED flashes.
#   * Known limit (unchanged, documented): if the mouse was moved while stopped, the
#     plan resumes from its stored position and its first move re-homes the cursor
#     into the plan region - HID has no position feedback channel. The complete fix
#     for that case is app-side cursor sync on start (queued for the C# line).
